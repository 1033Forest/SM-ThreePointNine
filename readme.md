To do
-----------
* Course modes
* Get sounds implemented accurately
* ~~Evaluation grades~~
* Finish evaluation screen
** Nearly complete, needs difficulty icons, personal best awards, and maybe something to replace the "bonus" meters.
* ~~Fix bugs with judgement (addy on Boo/Miss messes up positioning on further judgements)~~
* Improve details
* ~~Complete header with icons~~
** Getting closer on that
* Improve 4:3 support?
** The recent music wheel updates bring it more in line with the 4:3 UI.
* Other things not listed
