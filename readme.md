SMMAX5
-----------
SMMAX 5 is a "re-imagining"/port of the StepMania 3.9 default theme to StepMania 5.x

It is primarily based on the version as seen in 3.95, but with changes that reflect the changes and improvements to the theming system in newer versions of StepMania, remastered graphics in selected areas, and widescreen support amongst other changes. This is a collaborative project drawing upon the work of other (stalled) attempts to port the 3.9 default to 5, and new work by others.

It is still incomplete, but the basic gameplay experience is usable.
